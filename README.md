# The_Marken_Saga
A Battle for Wesnoth (http://www.wesnoth.org/) campaign featuring Marken

## About

The Marken Saga was something I made many years ago when I was much younger, and likely contains many things that I would be embarrassed by today. Nevertheless, and for whatever reason, I have dragged it into modernity by porting it to run on the latest stable release of Wesnoth.

## Installation

1. If you have not, install Wesnoth from http://wesnoth.org/. This version of The Marken Saga has only been tested to run on Wesnoth 1.12.

2. Clone or download the repository into the `add-ons` folder in your userdata directory. Depending on your platform, your userdata directory may be located in the following locations:

| Platform | Userdata location |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| Windows XP | ~/My Documents/My Games/Wesnoth 1.12/ |
| Windows Vista and above	| ~/Documents/My Games/Wesnoth 1.12/ |
| Mac OS X | ~/Library/Application Support/Wesnoth 1.12/ |
| Linux	| ~/.local/share/wesnoth/1.12/ |

You may either run `git clone https://github.com/yi-jiayu/The_Marken_Saga.git` while inside the `add-ons` directory, or download this repository as a ZIP archive and extract it to `add-ons/The_Marken_Saga`. The final directory structure should look similar to this:
```
Wesnoth 1.12
|- add-ons
   |- images
   |- maps
   |- scenarios
   |- units
   |- utils
   |- _main.cfg
```

3. Launch Wesnoth, and you should find The Marken Saga in your New Campaign menu.
